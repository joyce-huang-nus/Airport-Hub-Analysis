# Airport-Hub-Analysis
In this report, we analyzed the flight network worldwide. Through time series and network analytics, we investigated how the travel networks have been affected by the virus and the restrictions. However, lately as the restrictions are gradually lifted in many countries, we are expecting a recovery in tourism industry. By studying the travel networks in different stages of the regulations, hubs are identified. Coupled with the COVID policies in various countries, we aimed to optimize the airline travel operations to satisfy the needs of the newly revived tourism.
